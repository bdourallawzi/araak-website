Creating a website to practice and demonstrate my front-end capabilities; using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

At the moment, it is a basic e-commerce website adding products to the cart and the checking out with PayPal. 

Demonstrates JavaScript capbilities dynamically listing products from JSON file, presenting products in grid format with inflatable button to add to cart. 

The cart is presented as an overlay, with fuctionality of vary quantity based on which the total is called dynamically. 

A PayPal smart button is presented on the basket page, retrieving the data from PayPal and autofilling the input fields to allow a customer to make changes and select delivery method. This reducing the need for manual data entry.  
On confirming the data, a customer can pay, whereby the payment is captured. 

A thank you page is presented with order summary and customer information. 

The website is currently hosted on Netlify, [access it by clicking here](https://araak-clothing.netlify.com). 
I am still working on it, sorry if there are any bugs in the meantime. More features and flexibility to come!! (And less bugs :) )
